**ModalForm** displays a dialog that prompts the player to either confirm or cancel an action. It features two customizable buttonsâ€”one for submitting (confirming) and one for canceling. This form type is ideal for critical operations such as confirming "Are you sure you want to delete user data?" before proceeding.

## Using the Helper

The `PocketFormHelper::confirm` method allows you to quickly create a ModalForm. This helper abstracts away most of the setup so you can focus on your business logic.

### Example Using the Helper

```php
use XanderID\PocketForm\modal\ModalFormResponse;
use XanderID\PocketForm\PocketFormHelper;
use pocketmine\player\Player;

// Create a confirmation dialog using the helper method.
$form = PocketFormHelper::confirm(
    'Confirm Action', // Form title.
    'Are you sure you want to delete the user data?', // Form content.
    function (ModalFormResponse $response): void {
        /** @var Player $player */
        $player = $response->getPlayer();
        // Retrieve the player's choice: true means confirmed, false means cancelled.
        $isConfirmed = $response->getChoice();
        if ($isConfirmed) {
            $player->sendMessage('User data has been deleted.');
        } else {
            $player->sendMessage('Deletion cancelled.');
        }
    },
    'Yes, delete', // Custom text for the confirm button (optional).
    'No, cancel'   // Custom text for the cancel button (optional).
);

// Send the form to the player.
$player->sendForm($form);
```

## Using Instance

For more control over the form's configuration, you can directly instantiate a ModalForm and manually set its properties.

### Example Using Instance

```php
use XanderID\PocketForm\modal\ModalForm;
use XanderID\PocketForm\modal\ModalFormResponse;
use pocketmine\player\Player;

// Create a new ModalForm instance with a title.
$form = new ModalForm('Confirm Action');

// Set the form content and customize button texts.
$form->setBody('Are you sure you want to delete the user data?');
$form->setSubmit('Yes, delete'); // Confirm button text.
$form->setCancel('No, cancel');  // Cancel button text.

// Define a response listener to handle the player's selection.
$form->onResponse(function (ModalFormResponse $response): void {
    /** @var Player $player */
    $player = $response->getPlayer();
    $isConfirmed = $response->getChoice(); // Get the player's choice.
    if ($isConfirmed) {
        $player->sendMessage('User data has been deleted.');
    } else {
        $player->sendMessage('Deletion cancelled.');
    }
});

// Send the form to the player.
$player->sendForm($form);
```
