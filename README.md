## Introduction

PocketForm is a flexible PHP library exclusively designed to create interactive forms for PocketMine-MP servers. With its intuitive API and modular architecture, PocketForm simplifies the process of building formsâ€”ranging from basic menus to complex custom interfaces with dynamic validation and interactive elements.

## Features Overview

- **Multiple Form Types:** Easily create simple, modal, and custom forms.
- **Dynamic Elements:** Add inputs, dropdowns, sliders, toggles, and labels to enhance interactivity.
- **Custom Validation:** Implement built-in validators or create your own using closures.
- **Event Handling:** Attach callbacks for form responses, closures, and button interactions.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Utilize traits and a modular design for further customization.

## Installation

PocketForm can be installed via Composer by adding the following to your project's `composer.json`:

```json
"require": {
    "xanderid/pocketform": "^1.0.2"
}
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XanderID/PocketForm.git
```

## Quick Start Guide

To quickly get started, you can create a simple menu form using the PocketForm helper:

```php
use XanderID\PocketForm\PocketFormHelper;
use XanderID\PocketForm\simple\SimpleFormResponse;

$form = PocketFormHelper::menu(
    'Main Menu',
    'Please choose an option:',
    ['Play', 'Settings', 'Exit'],
    function (SimpleFormResponse $response) {
        $player = $response->getPlayer();
        // Handle the player's selection here.
    }
);

$player->sendForm($form);
```
